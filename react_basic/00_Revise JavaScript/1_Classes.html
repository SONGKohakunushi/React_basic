			To summarise.
				1. The constructor in the class is not mandatory, 
					it is written only when some initialization operations are performed 
					on the instance, such as adding specified properties.
				2. If class A inherits from class B, and the constructor is written in class A, 
					then the super in the constructor of class A must be called.
				3. The methods defined in the class are placed on the prototype object of the class for the instance to use.
