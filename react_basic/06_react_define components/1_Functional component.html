			Can't write MyComponent directly, you have to write it as a tag
			
			ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent/>.......) was executed What happens after that?
					1. React parses the component tag and finds the MyComponent component.
					2. The component is found to be defined using a function, 
							and render()  then called to get the virtual DOM.
							The returned virtual DOM is converted to a real DOM, which is then rendered in the page.
